Program reads a file in input format:
#of nodes
node1 node2
.
.
.
EOF
where node1<->node2 (undirected edge)

outputs number of degrees of each vertex/node and number of connected components 
additional features such as:
print every node and its connected edges and print each connected component's nodes can be used by uncommenting the labelled code




(done as part of a research position application; algorithm is well known (and quite easy to come up with) given a working knowledge of basic graph theory)
